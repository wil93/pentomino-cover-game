Pentomino covering game
=======================

In this game you have to cover the grid with pentominoes.

It is written in Python 2.x using Tkinter as GUI toolkit.
The game structure is very flexible: you can "easily" code different polyominos (but for the moment you must specify the coordinates of every cell, for every rotation).

USAGE
------

```python
python game.py
```
